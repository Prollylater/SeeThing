# Yet to be Named OpenGL-Based Application

This application offer a graphical interface and code base aiming to be modulable for testing and implementing computer vision algorithm going from segmentation to color transfer and much more.
The project is an OpenGL-based application utilizing ImGui for the graphical user interface, GLEW for managing OpenGL extensions, and CMake for building the project.
