# OpenGL ImGui Application

This project is an OpenGL-based application utilizing ImGui for the graphical user interface, GLEW for managing OpenGL extensions, and CMake for building the project.

MeshClouder is a standalone program developed in C++ for Linux and Windows. It allows you to transform 3D mesh files (in .obj and .ply formats) into point clouds.
The project aims to provide a user-friendly graphical interface to facilitate the conversion process. Users can adjust various parameters for the mesh-to-point cloud conversion and export the resulting point cloud as a .ply file.

## Features currently implemented 
- ImGui-based graphical user friendly interface (Should be soon!)
- Importing image (and soon mesh) and running them through numerous vision algorithm either visual or informative.
- Lot of parameters adjustments for conversion, modification and fine-tuning results.
